### Pipeline from scratch

So this is my repo for my pipeline from scratch project. I want to create pipeline from an API request (currently crypto currency) to data warehouse, and hopefully with automated orchestration. 

Example, with the api we currently getting we could create a daily crypto price table.

Current Progress:
- Adding docker-compose.yaml
- added dockerfile

Next:
- Create python script to ingest crypto api to postgres container

Thank you.
